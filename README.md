> **IMPORTANT NOTICE** This library is not needed anymore, because the `Tideways\Profiler` class is now provided directly by the `tideways` PHP extension. [Follow the Installation Guides](https://support.tideways.com/documentation/setup/index.html) to install the PHP extension.

# Tideways PHP Library

PHP Client Library for [Tideways PHP Profiler](https://tideways.io) platform.

Not using Tideways as a service and looking for a modern XHProf compatible Profiler?
See [Tideways PHP Extension](https://github.com/tideways/php-profiler-extension).

This repository only contains a snapshotted, compiled version of the PHP code base.

You can use it as a composer package, if you are using Tideways with HHVM, but
otherwise it is not needed to interact with this repository/package. For PHP
this source code is embedded into the DEB, RPM or Tarball downloads.
